[Futures trading](https://www.bitunix.com?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews) is a powerful financial tool that allows traders to buy or sell **cryptocurrency** at a predetermined price on a future date. This article will delve into the intricacies of futures trading, the differences between *futures vs [spot trading](https://www.bitunix.com?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews)*, and how platforms like **[Bitunix](https://www.bitunix.com/register?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews)** are revolutionizing the landscape with advanced features like **200x leverage** and **perpetual futures** contracts.

Understanding Futures Trading
-----------------------------

At its core, futures trading involves contracts that specify the purchase or sale of an asset at a predetermined price in the future. Unlike [spot trading](https://www.bitunix.com?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews), where transactions are settled immediately, futures trading allows for speculation on future price movements, offering traders the potential for significant profits or losses.
