What is Futures Trading?
------------------------

Futures trading involves contracts to buy or sell a **cryptocurrency** at a predetermined price on a future date. These contracts, known as **futures contracts**, allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency, such as **Bitcoin** or **Ethereum**, without owning the underlying asset.

Understanding Leverage for Beginners
------------------------------------

*Leverage* is a powerful tool in futures trading that allows traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. This concept is key to maximizing potential profits, but it also increases risk. For beginners, understanding how leverage works is essential to effective and responsible trading.

In essence, leverage is borrowed capital from the exchange, used to increase the size of a trading position. For example, using **200x leverage** means that for every $1 you have, you can trade $200 worth of cryptocurrency. This can amplify both gains and losses, making it crucial to understand the associated risks.

### Margin and Collateral

When using leverage, traders must provide *margin*, which is a security deposit to cover potential losses. The margin acts as *collateral* and varies depending on the leverage ratio. Understanding margin requirements is crucial to manage risk effectively in a trading environment.
