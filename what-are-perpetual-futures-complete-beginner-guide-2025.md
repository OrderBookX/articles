What Are Perpetual Futures? Complete Beginner Guide \[2025\]
============================================================

Welcome to the world of **perpetual futures**, a revolutionary financial instrument in the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto derivatives market continues to grow, with a historic $85.7 trillion in trading volume during 2025, understanding perpetual futures is crucial for traders and investors looking to maximize their investment opportunities.

Understanding Perpetual Futures Contracts
-----------------------------------------

Perpetual futures are a type of futures contract that does not have an expiration date. This unique feature allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, making them a popular choice among cryptocurrency traders seeking to capitalize on market trends without the constraints of contract expiration. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual futures utilize funding rates to keep their prices aligned with the underlying asset's spot price.
