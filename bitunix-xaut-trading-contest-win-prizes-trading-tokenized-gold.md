Market Volatility &amp; Strategy
--------------------------------

The year 2025 witnessed significant market volatility, with Bitcoin prices surging from $40,000 to $126,000 amid the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle. Open interest peaked at $235.9 billion, but a massive deleveraging event wiped out over $70 billion in positions, leading to total forced liquidations of approximately $150 billion. Navigating such volatile markets requires a strategic approach, leveraging tools like *Average True Range* and *Bollinger Bands* to manage risk and optimize returns.
