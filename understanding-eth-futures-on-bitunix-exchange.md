What Are ETH Futures?
---------------------

ETH futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Ethereum (ETH) without owning the actual cryptocurrency. These contracts can be settled in cash or physical delivery at the expiration date, but with **perpetual futures**, there is no expiration, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. This makes it a flexible tool for hedging and speculative strategies.
