What is Spot Auto Invest Crypto?
--------------------------------

Spot auto invest crypto is a feature offered by platforms like **[Bitunix](https://www.bitunix.com/register?vipCode=BITUNIXBONUS&utm_source=3rdparty&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews)** that allows users to automatically purchase cryptocurrencies at specified intervals. This *automated buying process* is designed to help investors mitigate market volatility by spreading purchases over time, a technique known as Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA).

### Understanding Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

Dollar-Cost Averaging is a strategy where an investor divides the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of the target asset, thus reducing the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. By investing the same amount regularly, investors buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high, potentially lowering the average cost per share over time.
