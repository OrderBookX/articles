[Futures trading](https://www.bitunix.com?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews) is a popular method for investors to speculate on the future prices of cryptocurrencies, commodities, and other assets. In this article, we explore **what futures trading** entails, the risks involved, and why platforms like the **[Bitunix](https://www.bitunix.com/register?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews) Exchange** are becoming increasingly significant in the crypto derivatives market.

Understanding Futures Trading
-----------------------------

Futures trading involves buying and selling **futures contracts**, which are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Unlike [spot trading](https://www.bitunix.com?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews), which involves immediate settlement, futures allow traders to speculate on price movements without owning the underlying asset.

- **Contract Size:** Refers to the amount of the underlying asset covered by the contract. It varies between exchanges and asset types.
- **Expiration:** The date when the futures contract must be settled. Some futures, like **perpetual futures**, do not have an expiration date.
- **Rollover:** The process of moving a position from an expiring contract to a new one.
