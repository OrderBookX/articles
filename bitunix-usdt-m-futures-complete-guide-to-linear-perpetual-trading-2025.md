======================================================================================================================================================================================================

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **[Bitunix](https://www.bitunix.com/register?vipCode=BITUNIXBONUS&utm_source=3rdparty&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews) USDT-M futures** trading. As a trader looking to capitalize on the dynamic world of *linear perpetual contracts*, understanding the intricacies of **Bitunix's platform** is crucial. This guide will delve into margin requirements, leverage options, and various trading strategies, including *perpetual futures* and how to effectively trade assets like XAUT and XAG/USDT.

What are Bitunix USDT-M Futures?
--------------------------------

Bitunix USDT-M futures are a type of **perpetual futures contract** that allows traders to speculate on the future price movements of cryptocurrencies using USDT as collateral. Unlike traditional futures, these contracts have no expiration date and can be held indefinitely. They utilize *funding rates* to ensure that the contract price aligns with the spot market.

### How Do Linear Perpetual Contracts Work?

**Linear perpetual contracts** operate similarly to traditional futures but with key differences. They are settled in the same currency as the collateral used, which in this case is USDT. This structure simplifies PNL calculations and reduces the complexity of managing multiple currency exposures.

----------------------------------------

To trade **Bitunix USDT-M futures**, understanding margin requirements and leverage options is critical. Here’s how they work:

- **Initial Margin:** The amount of collateral required to open a position.
- **Maintenance Margin:** The minimum collateral needed to keep a position open.
- **Leverage:** Bitunix allows traders to amplify their positions using borrowed funds, increasing potential profits and risks.

### Understanding Liquidation and Margin Calls

When trading with leverage, *liquidation* is a risk that traders must manage. A **margin call** occurs when your account balance falls below the *maintenance margin*, prompting the exchange to close your position to prevent further losses.
