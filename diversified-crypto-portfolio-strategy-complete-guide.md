Understanding Crypto Portfolio Diversification
----------------------------------------------

Before diving into the specifics of a *diversified crypto strategy*, it's crucial to grasp the fundamental concept of **diversification**. In simple terms, it involves spreading investments across various assets to reduce risk. This strategy is not only applicable to traditional investments but also to the dynamic realm of **cryptocurrency**.

### What is a Diversified Crypto Portfolio?

A **diversified crypto portfolio** consists of investing in multiple cryptocurrencies, rather than focusing solely on **Bitcoin** or a few **altcoins**. This approach helps mitigate the risk of significant losses due to the volatile nature of the [crypto market](https://www.bitunix.com?vipCode=BITUNIXBONUS&utm_source=3rdparty&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews).
