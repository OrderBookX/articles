Market Dynamics and Risk Management
-----------------------------------

The 2025 derivatives market was marked by extreme volatility. Open interest peaked at $235.9 billion on October 7 before a deleveraging event wiped out over $70 billion in positions. The October 10-11 crash, driven by geopolitical tensions, resulted in $19 billion+ in liquidations, predominantly from long positions. This highlights the critical importance of **risk management tools** and proper position sizing.
