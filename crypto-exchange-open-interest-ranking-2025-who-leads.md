---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Among the established giants, *[Bitunix](https://www.bitunix.com/register?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews)* emerged as a leading contender, recording the steepest growth slope among all tracked exchanges. It has become a preferred choice for traders seeking competitive leverage options, offering up to 200x leverage on BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT perpetual contracts. This rapid growth positions Bitunix as a promising alternative in the **crypto open interest ranking**.

Impact of Market Volatility
---------------------------

The derivatives market in 2025 was characterized by extreme volatility. The open interest peaked at $235.9 billion on October 7, before a significant deleveraging event resulted in the loss of over $70 billion in positions within days. A notable crash on October 10-11 led to more than $19 billion in liquidations, primarily from long positions. This event, triggered by geopolitical tensions, highlighted the necessity of robust risk management strategies.

Open interest (OI) is a crucial metric in the derivatives market, providing insights into market sentiment and trading positions. The peak global OI of $235.9 billion on October 7 reflected a highly leveraged market environment. However, the year-end OI settled at $145.1 billion, marking a 17% year-over-year increase. This growth indicates a sustained interest in derivatives trading despite market fluctuations.
