---------------------------------------------

A passive crypto investment strategy is designed for those who want to invest in cryptocurrencies without actively managing their portfolios on a daily basis. This approach is akin to creating a *lazy portfolio* in the traditional financial world. The primary objective is to achieve gradual growth and minimize risks through diversification and consistent investing over time.

### The Benefits of Passive Crypto Investing

- **Reduced Time Commitment:** Unlike day trading, passive investing doesn't require constant monitoring of the market.
- **Lower Stress Levels:** By avoiding the daily volatility and emotional rollercoaster of active trading, investors can enjoy peace of mind.
- **Automatic Diversification:** Passive strategies often involve spreading investments across various *cryptocurrencies* and *tokens*, reducing exposure to individual asset risk.
