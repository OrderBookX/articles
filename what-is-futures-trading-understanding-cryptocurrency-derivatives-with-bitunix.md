Introduction to Futures Trading
-------------------------------

Futures trading involves contracts that obligate the purchase or sale of a particular asset at a predetermined price and date. This trading strategy is popular in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets, offering traders a way to hedge against price movements or speculate on future price changes.

### Derivatives Explained: Futures Contracts and Perpetual Futures

Unlike **[spot trading](https://www.bitunix.com?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews)**, where assets are bought and sold for immediate delivery, futures contracts specify a later delivery date. **Perpetual futures**, a variation of futures contracts, have no expiration date and employ funding rates to align their prices with the underlying asset's spot price. This has made perpetual futures a favorite among crypto traders due to their flexibility.
