Understanding Futures Trading
-----------------------------

Futures trading involves buying and selling contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. Unlike *[spot trading](https://www.bitunix.com?inviteCode=ab9nr3&utm_source=news&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews)*, where transactions are settled immediately, futures contracts allow traders to speculate on price movements over time. This sophisticated form of trading requires a deep understanding of market trends, risk management, and strategic execution.

- **Leverage:** Futures trading often involves using *leverage*, allowing traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital.
- **Futures Contracts:** These are standardized agreements to buy or sell an asset at a future date and price.
- **Perpetual Contracts:** A type of futures contract with no expiration date, often used in cryptocurrency markets.
- **Risk Management:** Essential for long-term success, focusing on strategies to minimize potential losses.

How Much Capital Do You Need?
-----------------------------

One of the most common questions among aspiring traders is the amount of capital required to start trading futures. To pursue futures trading as a full-time career, it's recommended to have a starting capital of **$50,000 to $100,000**. This range provides a buffer to withstand market volatility and allows for strategic leverage usage.
