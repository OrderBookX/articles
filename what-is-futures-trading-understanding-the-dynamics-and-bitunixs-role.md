Understanding Futures Trading
-----------------------------

Futures trading involves contracts that obligate parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified future date. This type of trading is prevalent in markets involving commodities, currencies, and now, cryptocurrencies. The primary keyword, *futures trading psychology*, is crucial as traders must navigate the complexities and emotions involved in this speculative activity.

Futures contracts are standardized agreements traded on an exchange. The underlying asset could be a commodity, stock index, or cryptocurrency. Traders can use futures to hedge risk or speculate on price movements, using strategies such as **hedging** or **arbitrage**. The psychological aspect of futures trading cannot be overstated as it requires discipline and emotional control.
