Key Trends in Institutional Derivatives Trading
-----------------------------------------------

### Basis Trading and ETF Hedging

In 2025, **basis trading** became a normalized strategy among institutional traders. This involves exploiting the difference between spot and futures prices to generate returns. **ETF inflows** have also driven futures hedging, providing institutions with additional tools to manage exposure and risk effectively.

### Institutional Adoption and Regulatory Compliance

With the passage of the **GENIUS Act** in July 2025, the focus on **compliant trading** has intensified. Institutions are increasingly adopting crypto trading, driven by stringent regulatory frameworks that provide a clearer operational landscape. The shift from retail speculation to institutional hedging is evident, with leveraged funds reaching a net short position of 115,985 BTC at their peak.
