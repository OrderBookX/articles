What is Automated Crypto Investing?
-----------------------------------

Automated crypto investing refers to using sophisticated algorithms and technologies to manage cryptocurrency investments without continuous manual intervention.

The primary goal is to capitalize on market opportunities while reducing the emotional biases that can affect decision-making.

### How Does Automated Investing Work?

At the core of automated crypto investing is the use of **API** integrations, which connect your trading account with automated systems. These systems analyze market data, execute trades, and adjust your portfolio based on preset strategies. Popular strategies include **[Bitunix](https://www.bitunix.com/register?vipCode=BITUNIXBONUS&utm_source=3rdparty&utm_medium=blog-article&utm_campaign=labsnews) Crypto DCA** (Dollar Cost Averaging), which involves regularly buying a fixed amount of cryptocurrency to mitigate the impact of volatility.
