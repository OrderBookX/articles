Market Volatility and Its Implications
--------------------------------------

The year 2025 was marked by extreme volatility, with **open interest peaking at $235.9 billion** in early October. However, a massive deleveraging event followed, wiping out over $70 billion in positions within days. This dramatic shift was largely triggered by geopolitical tensions, notably Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, which led to $19 billion+ in liquidations, predominantly from long positions.

Such events underscore the importance of effective risk management tools and proper position sizing, as traders navigated these turbulent waters. The total forced liquidations for the year reached approximately $150 billion, highlighting the inherent risks in the derivatives market.

### Bitcoin's High-Beta Behavior

Bitcoin, as a high-beta asset, exhibited significant price fluctuations in response to global liquidity trends. During the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle, Bitcoin surged from $40,000 to a peak of $126,000 before the October correction. This behavior highlights Bitcoin's sensitivity to macroeconomic factors and its role as a sentiment indicator for the broader market.
